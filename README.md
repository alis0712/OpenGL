# OpenGL

Good day!

Feel free to browse through some of my projects done in OpenGL. 

~ The first project was to build a 2D house and the goal of this project was to get familiar with with some of the OpenGL functions like GL_POLYGON, GL_LINE_LOOP, etc. An output for this is provided below:

~ We were also tasked to build a simple house using Bezier surfaces the results were as follows:

~ The second project was to create a 3D face using points. The goal of this project was to get familiar with reading text files and implementing various openGL functions like points to the code base. An output for this project is provided below:

~ The third project was to create a 3D face using the concept of texture mapping. An image file along with vertices and points text files were taken in as inputs, the resulting outputs are provided below:

~ We were also tasked to create a face mesh using Bezier Patches the results was as follows:

~ The fourth project was to animate the 3D face created in project 3 using the concept of linear interpolation and non-linear interpolation using Slerp and Lerp techniques. the resulting output video with animations such surprise, anger, disgust, etc. is provided below:
